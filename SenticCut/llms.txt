# SenticCut - AI Video Editor for iOS

> SenticCut is an AI-powered video editing app for iPhone and iPad. Users upload a video, type a text prompt, and AI automatically edits the video with smart cuts, transitions, color grading, audio adjustments, and speed effects in under 30 seconds.

## Key Facts

- **Name:** SenticCut
- **Category:** AI Video Editor

## How It Works

1. **Select a video** from your photo library
2. **Type a text prompt** describing your desired edit (e.g., "cinematic with slow transitions", "fast-paced TikTok edit", "highlight the best moments")
3. **AI edits automatically** — smart cuts, transitions (dissolve, fade, cut), color grading (brightness, contrast, saturation), per-segment audio (volume, fade-in, fade-out, muting), and dynamic speed changes
4. **Export** the finished video to your camera roll

The entire process takes under 30 seconds.

## AI Technology

SenticCut uses Google Gemini AI to analyze video content. The AI watches the entire video, understands the content, and generates a complete editing plan based on the user's text prompt. This includes segment selection, transition types, color parameters, audio levels, and speed adjustments.

## Comparison with Other Editors

Unlike traditional video editors (CapCut, iMovie, Adobe Premiere Rush, InShot) that require manual timeline editing:
- SenticCut requires NO manual editing — everything is AI-driven
- No timeline interface — just a text prompt
- No learning curve — describe what you want in plain language
- Results in under 30 seconds vs minutes/hours of manual editing
