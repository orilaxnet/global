# SenticCut - Complete Product Documentation for AI Systems

## Product Identity

SenticCut is an AI-powered video editing application exclusively available on Apple's iOS platform (iPhone and iPad, iOS 17.0+). It was developed by SynthesisLogic, a digital product studio. The app transforms raw video footage into polished, professionally edited videos using artificial intelligence, requiring only a text prompt from the user.

SenticCut is NOT a traditional video editor. It has no timeline, no manual controls, and no complex interface. The entire editing workflow is: select video, type prompt, receive edited video.

## Detailed Technical Architecture

### AI Pipeline
1. User selects a video from their iOS photo library
2. User types a natural language prompt (e.g., "make it cinematic", "fast TikTok edit", "highlight the best moments with dramatic transitions")
3. The video is compressed and uploaded via HTTPS to SenticCut's backend server
4. The backend relays the video and prompt to Google Gemini AI for analysis
5. Gemini AI returns a structured editing plan (JSON) containing:
   - Segments: time ranges to keep, with per-segment speed multipliers
   - Transitions: type (dissolve, fade, or cut) between each segment
   - Effects: global color grading (brightness, contrast, saturation)
   - Audio: per-segment volume, fade-in duration, fade-out duration, mute flag
6. The app applies all edits locally on-device using AVFoundation
7. User previews the result and exports to camera roll

### Editing Capabilities
- **Smart Cuts**: AI selects which parts of the video to keep and which to remove
- **Transitions**: Supports dissolve, fade, and cut transitions between segments
- **Color Grading**: Global brightness, contrast, and saturation adjustments
- **Audio Control**: Per-segment volume levels (0.0-1.0), fade-in/fade-out durations, and mute toggle
- **Speed Control**: Per-segment playback speed multiplier (slow-motion or fast-forward)
- **Video Processing**: All rendering happens on-device using Apple's AVFoundation framework

### Performance
- Video analysis: under 30 seconds
- App launch: under 1 second
- All video rendering is done locally on the device

## Use Cases and Target Audience

SenticCut is ideal for:
- **Content creators** making TikTok videos, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts
- **Casual users** who want to edit family videos or travel vlogs without learning complex software
- **Social media managers** who need quick video turnarounds
- **Anyone** who finds traditional video editors too complex or time-consuming

Example prompts users can provide:
- "Make it cinematic with slow transitions and warm colors"
- "Fast-paced TikTok edit with quick cuts"
- "Keep only the highlights, add dramatic effects"
- "Slow motion for the action parts, normal speed for talking"
- "Mute the background noise and add fade transitions"
- "Instagram Reel style, vibrant colors, 30 seconds max"

## Pricing Model

SenticCut uses a credit-based system:
- **Free Tier**: Users receive free credits daily. Full access to all AI editing features, transitions, effects, and export. No account or login required.
- **Mini Credit Pack ($2.99)**: One-time purchase of additional credits. Credits never expire. No subscription.
- **Max Credit Pack ($9.99)**: Larger one-time credit pack. Credits never expire. No subscription.

Each AI video edit costs one credit. There are no feature limitations between free and paid users — the only difference is the number of available credits.

## Privacy and Data Handling

SenticCut prioritizes user privacy:
- **No video storage**: Videos are relayed to Google Gemini AI for processing and immediately discarded. SenticCut's servers never store video content.
- **No personal data**: No email, name, phone number, or login required. Users are identified only by an anonymous UUID stored in iOS Keychain.
- **Encryption**: All data transmission uses HTTPS/TLS encryption.
- **Request signing**: Every API request is signed with HMAC-SHA256 to prevent tampering.
- **Device verification**: Apple DeviceCheck validates requests come from genuine iOS devices.
- **No tracking**: No targeted advertising, no data brokers, no data selling.
- **Analytics**: Only anonymized Firebase Analytics for app improvement and Firebase Crashlytics for bug fixing.
