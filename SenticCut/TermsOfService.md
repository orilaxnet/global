PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE ("TERMS", "AGREEMENT") CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SENTICCUT MOBILE APPLICATION ("APP", "SERVICE") OPERATED BY SENTICCUT ("COMPANY", "WE", "US", "OUR"). THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION PROVISION (SECTION 14) AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER (SECTION 15) THAT AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.

By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the App, you ("User", "you", "your") acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy (incorporated herein by reference). If you do not agree to all of these Terms, you must immediately cease use of the App and delete it from your device.

YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS AS A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW.

## 1. Description of Service

SenticCut is an AI-powered video editing application that enables users to:

- Select videos from their device photo library
- Provide text-based creative direction (prompts)
- Receive AI-generated video edits including cuts, transitions, effects, and audio adjustments
- Export edited videos to their device

The App uses artificial intelligence (Google Gemini) via our backend servers to analyze and process video content. The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We make no representations or warranties regarding the availability, reliability, functionality, or suitability of the Service for any particular purpose.

---

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years of age to use this App. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18 (or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction), you may only use the App with the consent and under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms on your behalf. By using the App, you represent and warrant that you meet these eligibility requirements. If we learn that a user under 13 has provided personal information, we will promptly delete such information.

---

## 3. User Accounts & Identification

- The App does **not** require account registration, email, or password.
- A unique anonymous identifier (UUID) is automatically generated on your device and stored in your Apple Keychain (with iCloud Keychain sync).
- This identifier is used solely to track your credit balance, purchase history, and usage.
- You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your device and your anonymous identifier.
- You may reset your identifier at any time through Settings, which will irreversibly reset your credit balance and usage history. We bear no responsibility for credits or data lost as a result of an identifier reset initiated by you.

---

## 4. Credits & Payment

### 4.1 Free Credits
- Free users receive a daily allocation of credits, refreshed each day at a time determined by our servers.
- Daily credit amounts, per-request limits, and credit consumption rates are determined solely by our server configuration and may change at any time without prior notice.
- Unused free daily credits do not carry over to the next day.
- Free credits are a discretionary benefit and not a guaranteed entitlement. We reserve the right to modify, reduce, or eliminate free credit allocations at any time.

### 4.2 Paid Credits
- Additional credits can be purchased through in-app purchases via Apple's App Store.
- All purchases are processed exclusively by Apple Inc. and are subject to Apple's terms and conditions, including Apple's refund policies.
- Paid credits are added to your account balance and do not expire, subject to Section 13 (Termination).
- Credit packages and pricing are subject to change without prior notice.
- We are not responsible for any charges, fees, or taxes imposed by Apple, your payment provider, or any governmental authority in connection with your purchases.

### 4.3 Credit Consumption
- Credits are consumed based on the duration of video processed by the AI, at the rate displayed in the App.
- The credit consumption rate (credits per second/minute of video) is determined by our server and may change at any time.
- Credits are deducted at the time of AI analysis submission, regardless of whether: (a) the analysis completes successfully; (b) you are satisfied with the results; (c) you export the final video; or (d) the AI fails to process your content for any reason, including content safety filters.
- We are not obligated to refund credits consumed for failed, incomplete, or unsatisfactory analyses.

### 4.4 Refunds
- All credit purchases are final and non-refundable, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
- If you believe a purchase was made in error, you must contact Apple Support directly for refund requests pursuant to Apple's refund policies.
- Resetting your user identifier does not entitle you to a refund for previously purchased credits.
- We have no obligation to provide refunds, credits, or make-goods for any reason, including service outages, AI errors, or content processing failures.

## 5. User Content

### 5.1 Ownership
- You retain all rights, title, and interest in your original video content.
- You retain all rights to videos exported from the App.
- We do not claim ownership of any content you create, upload, or edit using the App.

### 5.2 License Grant
By using the App, you grant the Company a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, temporary license to:
- Transmit and pass your video content through our backend server to the Google Gemini API for the sole purpose of AI analysis and processing
- Transmit your text prompts to the Google Gemini API for processing
- Process metadata about your content (duration, format, size) for credit calculation and service delivery

This license terminates immediately upon completion of the AI processing for each individual request.

### 5.3 Content Handling
- **We do not store, retain, copy, or archive your video content or prompts on our servers.** Our server acts solely as a secure encrypted relay to the Google Gemini API.
- After AI processing is complete, no video data or prompt data remains on our infrastructure.
- We do not use your video content or prompts for training AI models, marketing, advertising, or any purpose other than providing the Service.
- We do not sell, share, license, or distribute your video content to any third party.

- Is owned by you or you have all necessary rights, licenses, and permissions to use it

- Does not contain sexually explicit or exploitative material involving minors
- Does not promote violence, hatred, terrorism, or discrimination
- Does not violate any applicable law, regulation, or ordinance

You are solely responsible for all content you process through the App. The AI system includes content safety filters that may refuse to process certain content. The presence of these filters does not constitute a guarantee of complete content moderation, nor does it shift responsibility for content from you to us.

### 5.5 Content Liability
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE COMPANY SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR ANY USER CONTENT PROCESSED THROUGH THE APP, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE LEGALITY, ACCURACY, APPROPRIATENESS, OR QUALITY OF SUCH CONTENT. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK AND LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR CONTENT.

**YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM, OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE (COLLECTIVELY, "DISPUTES") SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT**, except that either party may bring individual claims in small claims court if they qualify.

### 14.2 Arbitration Rules
Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect. If AAA is unavailable, the parties shall mutually agree on an alternative arbitration forum, or a court shall appoint one.

### 14.4 Arbitration Fees
For claims under $75,000, the Company shall pay all AAA filing fees and arbitrator compensation, unless the arbitrator determines that the claim was frivolous or brought in bad faith. For claims of $75,000 or more, fees shall be allocated as provided by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.

If you opt out, you and the Company agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California.

### 14.6 Severability of Arbitration
If any portion of this arbitration provision is found to be unenforceable, the remainder shall continue in full force and effect. If the class action waiver in Section 15 is found unenforceable with respect to a particular claim, then this entire arbitration provision shall be null and void with respect to that claim only.

---

## 15. Class Action Waiver

**TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND THE COMPANY EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.**

You and the Company each waive any right to a jury trial and any right to participate in a class action, collective action, or representative proceeding.

The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class, collective, or representative proceeding.

**NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL PRECLUDE EITHER PARTY FROM SEEKING PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, INCLUDING UNDER McGill v. Citibank, N.A., 2 Cal. 5th 945 (2017).**
