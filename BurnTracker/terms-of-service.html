    <h2>12. Binding Arbitration</h2>
    <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</strong></p>
    <h3>12.1 Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
    <p>You and BurnTracker agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the App shall be resolved through <strong>binding individual arbitration</strong> administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, rather than in court.</p>

        <li>Arbitration shall take place in Los Angeles County, California, or at your election, by telephone or video conference</li>
        <li>The arbitrator shall apply California substantive law</li>
        <li>For claims under $75,000, we will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees</li>
        <li>The arbitrator may award the same relief that a court could award</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>12.3 Opt-Out Right</h3>
    <p>You may opt out of this arbitration provision by sending written notice to <a href="mailto:support@synthesislogic.com">support@synthesislogic.com</a> within <strong>30 days</strong> of first accepting these Terms.

    </ul>

    <h2>13. Class Action Waiver</h2>
    <p class="caps-text">YOU AND BURNTRACKER AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</p>
    <p class="caps-text">IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN ARBITRATION, YOU AND BURNTRACKER EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</p>
    <p><strong>McGill Carve-Out:</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, this class action waiver does not apply to claims for public injunctive relief under California law, consistent with <em>McGill v. Citibank, N.A.</em>, 2 Cal. 5th 945 (2017). Any such claim for public injunctive relief shall be adjudicated in a court of competent jurisdiction in California.</p>

    <h2>14. Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>We shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to causes beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to: natural disasters, war, terrorism, pandemics, government actions, internet or network outages, power failures, Apple App Store outages or policy changes, iOS bugs or compatibility issues, or any other event beyond our reasonable control.</p>

        <li>Material changes will be communicated through the App when possible</li>
        <li>If you disagree with changes, you must stop using the App</li>
    </ul>
