        <div class="date-info">
            <strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 08, 2025<br>
            <strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 08, 2025
        </div>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how SketchGenius ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). SketchGenius is a creative canvas and AI-powered drawing application that allows users to create digital artwork, add text and images, and transform their creations using artificial intelligence.</p>

        <div class="important-section">
            <h2>IMPORTANT: What SketchGenius Does and Does NOT Do</h2>
            <p><strong>SketchGenius is a creative canvas and drawing application. We NEVER engage in face recognition, biometric data collection, or any form of facial analysis.</strong></p>
            
            <h3>Our App Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital Canvas:</strong> Create artwork using drawing tools and Apple Pencil support</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-layer Projects:</strong> Combine drawings, text, and images in organized projects</li>
                <li><strong>AI Art Generation:</strong> Transform your canvas creations using artistic style templates</li>
                <li><strong>Project Management:</strong> Save, organize, and edit your creative projects</li>
                <li><strong>Style Application:</strong> Apply various artistic effects to your canvas artwork</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What We NEVER Do:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Face Recognition:</strong> We do not identify, recognize, or analyze faces</li>
                <li><strong>Biometric Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect any biometric information</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Identification from Images:</strong> We do not analyze content for person identification</li>
                <li><strong>Face Tracking:</strong> We do not track or monitor facial features</li>
                <li><strong>Identity Analysis:</strong> We do not perform any form of identity verification through images</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technical Clarification:</h3>
            <p>SketchGenius processes your entire canvas artwork (drawings, text, and images) as artistic content for style transformation purposes only. This is similar to applying filters in photo editing apps - we process the visual content for artistic effects, not for identifying people or extracting biometric data.</p>
